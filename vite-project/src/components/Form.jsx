// What is State? A way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
  A state is required for each state cuz React only reads a line once so unless theres a change in state (that a hook is hooked into) it won't know to rerender, this is y we use state over normal funt
    React is declarative library so all we need to do is update our data and React will automatically react to it & update the pageâ€™s UI to reflect what has changed in that data. All we need to do is make sure the data updates correctly (useState - this will allow me to hook into the component, so whenever i update the state, MyForm cmpnt & React will update the UI based on any changes that happen to the val thats saved in useState) & React will handle the rest.

// When to use props when - 
Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that
component can determine what will get displayed on the
screen.

// When to use state when - 
Anytime you want a component to maintain some values from
within the component. (And "remember" those values even
when React re-renders the component).

  // CBF in set funt
callback function will
     * receive the old value of state as its parameter,
     * which you can then use to determine your new
     * value of state.

// Props are immutable. State is mutable.

  // grab user input
